# Understanding macOS Terminal
A note especially for those who confuse Terminal with Unix shell like me...

1. The macOS **Terminal** is an application to provide a text input/output environment for **Unix shells**. <br>
1. A **Unix shell** is a program that provides a command-line user interface to navigate Unix or Unix-like OS.
1. macOS is a Unix variant. So Terminal gives you a way to interact with macOS via a Unix shell.
1. Terminal supports several Unix shells, such as *csh*, *bash*, *zsh*, etc.
1. Technically speaking, it is incorrect to say "Terminal commands" as Terminal doesn't execute commands but just send them to a Unix shell. 
1. **Darwin** is the core of macOS. It is itself a Unix-like operating system and is mainly in charge of the non-graphical portion of macOS. So you'll encounter the term "*Darwin*" from time to time when you use Terminal.
1. Terminal can connect to a Unix shell not only on your computer but also on a different computer over a network.
