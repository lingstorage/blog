## Terminology
|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| repository | A directory where version control is managed by git | 
| tracked file | A file whose change is tracked by git | 
| snapshot | The state of tracked files at a given point in time |
| stage | To make created/updated files the candidate of a new snapshot |
| commit (verb) | To create a new snapshot that reflects the changes in staged files |
| commit (noun) | A committed snapshot / an act of committing |
| commit ID | A unique SHA-1 hash assigned to a commit |
| branch | An isolated working place which has its own commit history and can diverge from or merge with another branch <br>(**Technical definition** : A branch is a pointer which refers to a specific commit, and its reference target moves along with each new commit) | 
| master | The default branch name which is automatically created when the first commit is created |
| clone | To make a copy of a repository |
| local repository | A copy of a repository |
| origin | The original repository of a local repository |
| remote repository | Another repository connected to a local repository <br> (e.g. *origin* is the default remote repository of a local repository) |
| local branch | A branch in a local repository |
| remote-tracking branch | A branch in a local repository, but separated from local branches, to track changes in a remote repository |
| upstream | A remote-tracking branch associated with a local branch <br> (e.g. the remote-tracking branch called "*origin/master*" is the default upstream of the local *master* branch) |
